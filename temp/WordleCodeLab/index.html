        <h2 is-upgraded>What is Wordle and what does it need?</h2>
<p>Wordle is a word guessing game, that the user guess a random word and get clues based on past guess</p>
<p>So some things we will need, randomness, and a word bank and game logic.</p>
<pre><code>import random

words = [&#39;gamed&#39;, &#39;usfgdc&#39;, &#39;tired&#39;, &#39;cofee&#39;, &#39;ineed&#39;]

def main():

main()
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Probably a good idea to include some Instructions to the game at the top, so lets add a function</h2>
<pre><code>def Intro():
    print(&#34;This is Wordle&#34;)
    print(&#34;\tâœ… - letter is the word and is in correct spot&#34;)
    print(&#34;\tðŸŸ¨ - letter is the word and is not in the right spot&#34;)
    print(&#34;\t _ - letter is not in the word&#34;)
    print()
</code></pre>
<p>Call the function in your main</p>
<pre><code>import random

words = [&#39;gamed&#39;, &#39;usfgdc&#39;, &#39;tired&#39;, &#39;cofee&#39;, &#39;ineed&#39;]

def Intro():
    ...

def main():
    Intro()
    
main()
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Picking a random word in the word bank</h2>
<pre><code>def main():
    Intro()
    hiddenWord = words[random.randint(0, len(words)-1)]
</code></pre>
<p>Also wordle has a limited number of trys, so lets add that too.</p>
<pre><code>hiddenWord = words[random.randint(0, len(words)-1)]
attempts = 5    # NEW CODE HERE
</code></pre>

        <p>Duration 0:07:00</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Design and Logic</h2>
<p>What we want:</p>
<ul>
<li>While user still has an attempt left, allow them to guess</li>
<li>Take the user&#39;s input/guess</li>
<li>If User guess the hidden word then end game, Otherwise do some wordle game logic to give a glue</li>
<li>Remove an attempt per guess and tell the player</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>def main():
    Intro()
    hiddenWord = words[random.randint(0, len(words)-1)]
    attempts = 5

    # NEW CODE HERE
    while (attempts &gt; 0):
        guess = input(&#34;Enter Guess (5 Letter Word): &#34;).lower()

        if (guess == hiddenWord):
            print(&#34;Good Guess!!!&#34;)
            break
        else:
            # Do wordle clue logic
        
        attempts -= 1
        print(f&#34;{attempts} are left.\n&#34;)
</code></pre>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Word guess logic" duration="7">
        <h2 is-upgraded>Design and Logic</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create an output that tells us something about the hidden word</li>
<li>Check for every letter in the guess If it is in the same spot of the hidden word, give it a checkmark</li>
<li>else if the letter is in the word, mark it as yellow</li>
<li>otherwise leave it blank</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Doing it in code</h2>
<pre><code>if (guess == hiddenWord):
    print(&#34;Good Guess!!!&#34;)
    break
else:
    # NEW CODE HERE
    output = &#34;&#34;
    for hiddenLetter, guessLetter in zip(hiddenWord, guess):
        if (hiddenLetter == guessLetter.lower()):
            output += &#34; âœ… &#34;
</code></pre>
<p>Since if statements will skip else-if and else statements when true, we can just stack these statements logically for easy implementation</p>
<pre><code>else:
    output = &#34;&#34;
    for hiddenLetter, guessLetter in zip(hiddenWord, guess):
        if (hiddenLetter == guessLetter.lower()):
            output += &#34; âœ… &#34;

        # NEW CODE HERE
        elif (guessLetter in hiddenWord):
            output += &#34; ðŸŸ¨ &#34;
        else:
            output += &#34; _ &#34;

    print(output)       #outside of the loop

        <h2 is-upgraded>Lets reveal the secret word if user run out of attempts</h2>

            if (attempts == 0):

<h2 is-upgraded>Now Your wordle is already functional logically, HOORAY</h2>
<p>However, you may notice that you can enter non-real words and it still runs unlike wordle</p>
<p>Additionally, you also may realize that if we want more words, we will have to expand our list which makes it ugly and wonder why do that manually</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Design and Logic</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make it so that we can not guess random letters, and actually have to guess words</li>
<li>Not take User&#39;s attempt or run logic not in our word bank</li>
<li>Make it so that our word bank can be larger without bad code</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Coding our Design</h2>
<pre><code>while (attempts &gt; 0):
    guess = input(&#34;Enter Guess (5 Letter Word): &#34;).lower()

    # NEW CODE HERE
    if (guess not in words):            # because we are arrogant if we dont know it, it doesn&#39;t exist
        print(&#34;Word not in word list, Try another word\n&#34;)
        continue
    # NEW CODE END

    if (guess == hiddenWord):

<h2 is-upgraded>Optional, Rather than having Colored squares you can have colored text by replaceing the logic part with this code</h2>
